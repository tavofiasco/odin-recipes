        <h3>Hands down, the best meatloaf you will have ever had!</h3>

        <p>
            While on the search for fantastic meatloaf, I came across and old family recipe.
            After a bit of tinkering and iterations, I dare say to have created the ultimate, flavorful recipe.

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>

                2 eggs
            </li>

                1½ pounds ground beef
            </li>
            <li>
                1 onion, chopped
            </li>
            <li>
                1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
            </li>
            <li>
                ½ cup shredded carrot
            </li>
            <li>
                ¼ cup brown sugar
            </li>
            <li>
                ¼ cup ketchup
            </li>
            <li>
                1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk eggs, milk, salt, and ground black pepper in a large bowl. Add crumbled bread and stir until dissolved. Mix ground beef, onion, Cheddar cheese, and carrot into bread mixture; transfer mixture to a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Combine brown sugar, ketchup, and mustard in a small bowl; spread over meat mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 1 to 1 1/4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
