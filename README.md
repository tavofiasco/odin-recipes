Welcome to my recipes project!

Using the basics of HTML, I have created a simple site that links to a couple other pages with the same layout. It displays the HTML structure, along with using simple links that are relative to the site (along with the images), ordered and unordered lists, paragraphs and headings.

I also used CLI and git to update my repository on GitHub for whenever changes were made to the site, adding comments that explained the recent changes until finally pushing the final project.
